I'm a fan of open source, privacy-preserving projects, and decentralized technologies.

### My story

🎮 I have enjoyed computers since I was a kid. Initially, it was all about playing games (NFS III, NHL 99, THPS 2, Half-Life, HoMaM III, real-time strategies and adventures).

🌐 Then I discovered the power of the Internet—I’m from the generation that remembers Internet cafés, dial-up connection, ICQ, website catalogs before Google, or indie bands' profiles on MySpace.

👩‍💻 In a high school informatics class, I coded "Matrix" in Turbo Pascal (random characters in green on black background running in an infinite loop) which felt amazing 😀. Around that time, we also watched the first-ever YouTube videos.

📱 I originally worked as an accountant, but a persistent interest in tech led me to change career paths. While studying at a software engineering academy, I became especially interested in Android app development (one project was [Triedenie-Odpadu-Kosice](https://github.com/MonikaJassova/Triedenie-Odpadu-Kosice)).

🕵️‍♀️ Professionally, I started with manual testing of web, mobile, and desktop applications. I soon recognized the value of automation and sought opportunities to reduce repetitive manual tasks.

📊 Next, I worked on a data engineering project involving ETL testing (using ScalaTest) and gained experience with Apache Hadoop & Spark, Neo4j, and various BI tools and dashboards.

🔐 I then joined a data-protection blockchain project, which was both fascinating and complex. Collaboration with the SRE team and exposure to SDLC intricacies sparked my interest in DevOps, inspiring me to pivot into the field.
